## Wikiart Artist and Genre Scraper

This is a simple Selenium based Wikiart.org scraper that I built to get all the artist names and genres of Wikiart. The Scraping results can be found in the "Word List" folder. The scraping of those files was performed on the 28.08.2022 and may therefore no longer be up to date.
